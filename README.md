# Progressive Web App (PWA) - Weather Search
This is a simple Progressive Web App (PWA) that provides the look and functionality of a native app. The project focuses on key PWA features such as service workers for caching resources and enabling offline functionality, and a manifest file to define how the app should appear and behave. The app allows users to search for weather-related information using a third-party API.

## Features
- Service Workers: Enable caching of resources and offline functionality.
- Manifest File: Defines the app's appearance and behavior (e.g., icons, theme color, display mode).
- Weather Search: Users can query weather information for any location.
- Offline Support: The app can function offline by serving cached resources.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5: For structuring the app's content.
- CSS3: For styling and responsive design.
- JavaScript: For dynamic functionality.
- React: For building the user interface.
- Service Workers: For caching and offline support.
- Third-Party Weather API: For fetching real-time weather data.
